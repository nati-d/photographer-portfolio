					MY BIOGRAPHY
				</h2>

				<div className='space-y-6 text-muted-foreground text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed'>
					<p>
						My name is Zadig, and I've spent over a decade behind the camera capturing moments that matter. What began as a simple curiosity with
						photography has grown into a lifelong mission: to tell real stories with elegance, honesty, and heart.
					</p>

					<p>
						I specialize in wedding, maternity, family, graduation, and portrait photography—each one with its own rhythm and emotion. Whether I'm
						documenting a joyful wedding day, a mother's quiet anticipation, or a proud graduation moment, I aim to create more than beautiful
						images—I create lasting memories that reflect your unique story.
					</p>

					<p>
						Working with clients locally, nationally, and internationally, I bring flexibility, professionalism, and creative vision to every shoot.
						I take the time to listen, plan, and guide each step, making sure the process feels effortless and meaningful for you. My editing style
						is clean, timeless, and rooted in storytelling, highlighting emotion while preserving natural beauty.
					</p>

					<p>
						What truly drives me is connection. Photography is not just about what you see—it's about how you feel. I'm deeply honored each time
						someone trusts me to capture their important moments, and I bring that respect into every session, every image, every detail.
					</p>

					<p>For me, this work isn't just a job. It's a calling—and I'm here to help you preserve life's most meaningful chapters.</p>
